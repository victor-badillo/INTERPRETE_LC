Introduction:
    This is user manual purpose is to ilustrate the user with some examples the new developed functionalities.
    
1.1 Multiline expressions.

1.2 More complete "Pretty-printer".
    To implement this section, a modification was first made in main.ml to return the type string before the term string. 
    After this small change, lambda.ml was specifically modified in the string_of_term function. 
    This function was subdivided, creating a cascade of functions that call each other according to the expression encountered, 
    adding brackets only when required and removing any excess brackets. The subfunctions created are string_of_appTerm and string_of_atomicTerm. 
    Additionally, excess brackets were removed in string_of_ty.

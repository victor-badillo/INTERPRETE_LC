USER MANUAL

LAMBDA-CALCULUS INTERPRETER

AUTHOR: Víctor Nathanael Badillo Aldama

Introduction:
    This is user manual purpose is to ilustrate the user with some examples the new developed functionalities.
    
1.1 Multiline expressions.

1.2 More complete "Pretty-printer".
    To implement this section, a modification was first made in main.ml to return the type string before the term string. 
    After this small change, lambda.ml was specifically modified in the string_of_term function. 
    This function was subdivided, creating a cascade of functions that call each other according to the expression encountered, 
    adding brackets only when required and removing any excess brackets. The subfunctions created are string_of_appTerm and string_of_atomicTerm. 
    Additionally, excess brackets were removed in string_of_ty.

    In order to obtain a good identation it is necessary to change the return value of string_of_term and directly print in the screen the string_of_term.
    For simplicity me change the name of string_of_term to pretty_printer. Depending on the kind of term, we use a box to encapsulate a part of the output
    and insert the apropiate identation. print_space() is used in order to break line or insert a white space.

2.1 Fixed-point combinator
    ...
    In order to declare recursive functions and not recursive functions without the use of operator in, it is necessary to modify de parser and create
    a rule for this two cases. One rule for let was created in the 'term' rule and one other for letrec.

2.4 Tuples
    lexer.mll: 3 new tokens were included in the sintaxis, curly brackets and comma for separating inside the tuple.
    parser.mly: a new rule is used for indexing one element inside the tuple. This rule will try to math the case for indexing one element. If it was not
    possible, then it will continue normally as before including this rule, trying to match an atomic term. It does not exist any priority inside this rule,
    therefore one '|' is placed before every possible match.
    The new tuple is assigned to a TmTuple term, which must have at least one element.
    Projections are included, so this new term is considered. This will be used as a list of string. We could think that is not a good idea because the Projections
    in tuples uses number for referecing terms but this is done for reusing it for records later on.

Introduction:
    This tecnic manual purpose is to explain what modules from the original implementation have been modified and what
    kind of changes were done to obtain de the final implementation.
